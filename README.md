# Neural Network From Scratch


This is a simple neural network from scratch, lightly annotated for my own personal understanding.

Mostly this is a thinly wrapped (and in many places, wholesale) version of [Jason Brownlee's wonderful How to Code a Neural Network with Backpropagation In Python (from scratch)](https://machinelearningmastery.com/implement-backpropagation-algorithm-scratch-python/).
